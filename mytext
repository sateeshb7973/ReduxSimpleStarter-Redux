Redux is a Javascript framework.
Redux is a state container.
Redux is a collection of all the data that describes the application.
which is not only includes hot data like list of books but also meta level data like what is the currently selected book.

The special differentiation compared to flux,angular or backbone about the Redux is it maintains all the app data in centralized single object which refers to state.

Reducer - is a function that returns state object
Creating a reducer is a 2 step process
step 1, is creating Reducer
step 2, is wire up the reducer to the application. Will do this in index.js of reducer folder.

Create a react Component

combining react and reducers is done through the react-redux library

we have to promote our react component to container,
A container is nothing but a react component that has a direct connection to the state  which is managed by redux.

The decision of promoting a react component to a container is depends on whether the component care about the sate or not.
